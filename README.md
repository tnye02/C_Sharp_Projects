# Terry Nye C# Projects 
This is the repository for my basic C# projects for The Tech Academy.

Some of the highlights include:

## Car Insurance Quote Generator
Decides what someone's quote should be based on a number of factors. This project demonstrates ASP.NET ENTITY FRAMEWORK MVC structure.

## Shipping Quote Calculator
Takes the size and weight of a packaged and decides what the shipping rate will be if the package is not too big or two heavy.

## Server Time Website
This is a basic website hosted with Azure that outputs the current server time.

## Anonymous Income Comparison
This is a basic demonstration of math operations in C#.

## Insurance Approval Application
Basic insurance approval application demonstrating boolean operations.

## Calling Methods Project
Simple application that demonstrates calling methods in different classes.

## Step 285 - Void Methods
Basic use of void methods, static classes, overloading methods and output paramaters.

## Step 383 - Constructors Demo
Demontstrates how to overload constructors with multiple different parameters requirements.

## Step 369 - DateTime Usage
Basic app that uses DateTime data type to calculate and display different dates and times.

## While and Do While Loops
A simple program that utilizes both a while loop and a do while loop.

## Iteration assignment
Uses for loops to check for strings in arrays and lists in different ways.

## Lambda vs foreach
Demonstrates some of the differences in using lambda expressions versus using foreach loops and some of the benefits of both.

## Enum project
Shows the usesfulness of using enums and how to parse them.

## Operator overloading
Created multiple methods of the same name that take different sets of parameters. C# knows which one you mean by what you give it when you call the methods.
