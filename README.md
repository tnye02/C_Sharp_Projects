# C_Sharp_Projects
 
This is the repository for my basic C# projects for The Tech Academy.

Some of the highlights include:

### Car Insurance Quote Generator
Decides what someone's quote should be based on a number of factors. This project demonstrates ASP.NET ENTITY FRAMEWORK MVC structure.

### Server Time Website
This is a basic website hosted with Azure that outputs the current server time.
